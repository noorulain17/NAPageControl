  s.description  = <<-DESC
    Designers love to make beautifully custom page controls that fit in with all the wood,
    gradients, and inner shadows they've worked so hard perfecting.

    Who can blame them?! NAPageControl makes it dead simple to give them what they want. Even
    better, NAPageControl is a drop in replacement for UIPageControl. It mirrors all the functions
    of UIPageControl, with literally no changes beyond the class name.
